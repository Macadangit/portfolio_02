Updated portfolio website

The design of this website was completely done myself but the development heavily leveraged GPT. I didn't want to spend more time on the site than on my other projects and studying, so I leveraged AI to speedup the dev process. I will always be transparent about my usage of AI because I want people to be able to trust me when I specify that a project didn't use AI at all.
